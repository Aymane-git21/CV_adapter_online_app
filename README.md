# CV_adapter_internship_getter_unemployement_finisher_v2000

tired of getting rejected by your dream jobs and internships because your CV is “too much”?
yeah. same.

you’re not wrong for having 27 half-finished projects and a github graveyard full of “potential”.
recruiters just don’t speak *passion-fueled chaos*.

so here’s the deal:

drop your **generalist LaTeX CV (.tex)** and the **job description**, and this thing will spit out:

* a **tailored CV** that matches the role like it was *built for it*
* a **cover letter** that sounds human, confident, and annoyingly “aligned with the company values”

not so you don’t get rejected…
but so you get rejected for the honest reason:

**you’re not qualified.** 💀

## what you need

* your current CV in LaTeX (`.tex`)
* the job description (copy/paste or file)

## what you get

* `cv_tailored.tex` (optionally PDF if you compile)
* `cover_letter.txt` / `.tex`

## why this exists

because “one CV fits all” is a lie recruiters tell to sleep at night.

## warning

* this tool won’t invent experience. it’ll just weaponize what you already did.
* read the output before you send it unless you enjoy self-sabotage.

## usage (probably)

```bash
python main.py --cv cv.tex --jd jd.txt --out out/
```

have fun. go get that internship BIG BOY (or GIRL, we dont judge)
